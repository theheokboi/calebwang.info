# **Caleb** J. Wang 

I'm a third year Ph.D. student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu)'s Computer Science department, where I work with Prof. [Fabi√°n E. Bustamante](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~fabianb/) in [AquaLab](https://aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu).
My research interest generally lies in Network Measurements, where I try to understand underlying characteristics of the Internet by measuring and observing performance of the network. 
Currently, I am conducting a cross-layer analysis of network-level measurements and the infrastructure beneath to understand Internet consolidation at the physical level.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Master's degree in Communication Engineering, both from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/).
I worked briefly as a customer engineer at Microsoft, Taiwan before joining Northwestern. 

During my spare time, you can find me brewing (decent) shots of espresso, banging my head against [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTyxnUZMA1k), or writing unnecessarily complicated Javascript for simple websites like this one.
